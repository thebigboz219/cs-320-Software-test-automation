How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
	The easiest way to ensure your code is functional and secure is to constantly review it. Throughout this project I would reread and possibly rewrite every couple lines of code because I would find something I did wrong. When methods or functions are completed it becomes important to test the method with all manner of input. You want to ensure that no errors are unaccounted for and that sections won't be skipped over due to wrong state checkers. Once you've tested your methods relentlessly it helps to try out your code on another system to see if different components bring about new errors or if the software has trouble transporting between systems.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
	User needs are seen sometimes as the hidden requirements in code. What the user needs is part of why the program is being created. Now not everything the user says they need gets into the program, sometimes due to limitation in capability but they still attempt to include them. I look at user needs as part of the checklist for the program. Depending on how broad the user's need may be it can help to discuss in more detail what the user is aiming for. This way you can go back in knowing more about what to code in order to meet the requirements given.

How do I approach designing software?

	Software development for me is a iterative but slow process where I spend a section of time writing code and then go back and review everything for errors. I also make it a point not to write more than one or two sections per day. This ensures I go in each time thinking entirely on the current section and how it functions, rather than having the previous section looming on my mind as I try to move on. Once all sections of a project are complete I review each one again from scratch to see if I missed anything before. After everything's been reviewed I test individual sections then the entire program at once to ensure all functions operate along side each other.
